			<h2>Subtheme: Trends and Patterns in Drug Overdose Fatalities in Allegheny County</h2>
			<h3>Introduction</h3>

			<p>Accidental overdose deaths have surged in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, highlighting a critical public health concern that this analysis seeks to explore. This exploratory data analysis (EDA) aims to identify trends in these incidents by examining demographic factors such as age, gender, race, and the drugs involved, as well as geographic details. Using data published by the Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center, this analysis seeks to uncover key insights to better understand the crisis and help develop strategies for prevention.</p>

			<h3>About the dataset</h3>
			<p>The dataset contains 7,136 records of fatal accidental overdose incidents in Allegheny County, collected by the county's Medical Examiner’s Office and published by the Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center. It includes details such as the date and time of death, the decedent’s age, sex, race, drugs involved in the overdose (up to 10 substances), and the zip codes for both the incident location and the decedent’s residence (although this data is no longer available). The dataset was created on February 14, 2019, last updated on September 11, 2024, and is available in CSV format. It spans multiple years and provides insights into the demographic and geographic patterns of overdose deaths, aiding in the analysis of this ongoing health crisis.</p>
			
			<h3>Overall Analysis Questions</h3>
			<ol>

				<li>How has the increase in drug overdose deaths involving antidepressants over the years impacted overall overdose trends in Allegheny County?</li>
				<p> <b>Motivation:</b>” Drug overdose deaths involving antidepressants have risen sharply from 1,749 in 1999 to 5,863 in 2022, according to CDC WONDER.” After reading this statement from National Institute on Drug Abuse about
					<a href="https://nida.nih.gov/research-topics/trends-statistics/overdose-death-rates#Fig10">Drug Overdose Deaths: Facts and Figures</a> and  With the growing rates of depression and mental health issues, I wanted tpo investigate whether this trend is also evident in Allegheny County and if antidepressants could be contributing significantly to the local health crisis. This analysis aims to determine if antidepressants are a major factor in overdose deaths in the county and if they pose a significant public health concern.</p>
				<li>Which demographics are most affected by drug overdoses?</li>
				<p> <b>Motivation:</b> From movies and books, it often seems like Black people and males are primarily depicted as being affected by drug addiction, with a strong focus on young people. I want to explore whether these media portrayals reflect reality in Allegheny County. My goal is to see if certain races, genders, or age groups are indeed more affected by drug overdoses, and to understand if young people are particularly vulnerable.</p>
				<li>What type of drugs are most commonly involved in overdose fatalities?</li>
				<p> <b>Motivation:</b>Movies often highlights cocaine  and heroine as a major drugs involved in overdoses, but I want to investigate if this is the case in real life. I’m interested in learning about which drugs are most commonly linked to overdose fatalities in Allegheny County and whether other substances play a more significant role than those frequently shown in movies and series.</p>
				<li>Which regions in Allegheny County are most affected by drug overdose fatalities?</li>
				<p> <b>Motivation:</b> Understanding the geographic distribution of overdose fatalities can reveal which areas are experiencing the highest impact from the crisis. By identifying the most affected regions within Allegheny County, we can better target prevention efforts and allocate resources where they are needed most. This analysis aims to provide insights into regional disparities and help focus intervention strategies.</p>
				<li>Are there specific times of the day when drug overdoses are more prevalent?</li>
				<p> <b>Motivation:</b>I want to explore whether drug overdose fatalities increase during certain times of the year, such as during festive seasons or other specific periods. By examining seasonal patterns, we can determine if there are times when overdoses become more frequent and potentially adjust public health responses and prevention strategies accordingly.</p>
				<li>How have drug overdose fatalities changed over the years?</li>
				<p> <b>Motivation:</b>To understand the progression of the overdose crisis, I want to create a time series analysis to track changes in overdose fatalities over the years up to the present. This will help identify trends, fluctuations, and long-term patterns in the data, providing a clearer picture of how the crisis has evolved and informing future public health strategies.</p>

			<h2>Discoveries & Insights</h2>

				<figcaption>
					From the graph, it is evident that individuals in their 30s are the most affected by overdose incidents, followed closely by those in their 40s. The data shows a gradual increase in overdose cases with age, peaking in middle age, and then decreasing among older age groups. The number of cases starts low among younger individuals and rises steadily through the 20s and 30s. Notably, there are a few cases reported in the 0-15 age range, which may suggest data entry errors or rare cases of poisoning rather than typical overdose incidents. This graph provides valuable insights into how age impacts overdose fatalities, highlighting the age groups most at risk.

				<img src="images/demographic.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
					The data indicates that overdose fatalities in Allegheny County predominantly affect White males, followed by White females, with Black males and females experiencing lower rates of fatalities. This pattern challenges the common media narratives that often portray drug addiction as more prevalent among Black communities and males overall. It's important to recognize that these findings are specific to Allegheny County and may not be representative of trends across the entire United States, where demographic impacts of overdose can vary significantly by region. This analysis highlights the importance of using localized data to understand which demographic groups are most at risk and to inform targeted public health strategies.

				<img src="images/antidepressant.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
					In Allegheny County, antidepressants were involved in only two overdose fatalities, recorded in 2007 and 2009, both in combination with other drugs. This is in stark contrast to the national trend of increasing antidepressant-related overdose deaths, indicating that antidepressants are not a major public health concern locally. This underscores the importance of examining local data to understand regional differences in overdose trends.
